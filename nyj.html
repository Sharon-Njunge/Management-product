    NYJ SUMMARY 1 & 2
</p>

<p>
    In born a crime by Trevor	 Noah, the opening chapters introduce key themes and issues that resonate with <br>
    Kiambu county. In chapter one, Noah explores his childhood in apartheid-era South Africa, where his existence <br>
     as the biracial child of a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father was illegal under the oppressive regime. <br>

       status can deeply influence one’s opportunities and treatment within society.

Chapter 2 delves into Noah's experiences navigating the complexities of race and identity, particularly the challenges <br>
 he faced in establishing connections with both black and white relatives. Similarly, in Kiambu county, the legacy of <br>
 colonialism and ethnic divisions can create barriers to social cohesion among diverse communities <br>

 spirit of many individuals in Kiambu county, where resourcefulness and determination are essential for survival and <br>
  progress.

        a significant role in shaping daily life.
